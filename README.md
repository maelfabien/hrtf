# HRTF
Head-related transfer function used to simulate direction of the audio source, implemented with OpenCV, PyAudio and Numpy. Requires impulse responses e.x. from [CIPIC HRTF Database](https://www.ece.ucdavis.edu/cipic/spatial-sound/hrtf-data/) (to check the script, just download Matlab version of the database and take any hrir_final.mat file).
